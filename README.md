Language Switcher Dropdown
==========================

Language Switcher Dropdown enhances the core Language Switcher block by
displaying it as a dropdown menu. It also adds block settings that let you:

- Display language codes instead of names (e.g. 'en' instead of 'English')
- Customise the text used for the dropdown menu (can be either the active
  language (in which case that language is hidden from the menu), or custom
  text of your choice)

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Add the 'Language switcher' block to a region and configure its settings
  appropriately.
